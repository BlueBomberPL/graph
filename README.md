Basic Graph Generator (BGG)

This program gives an oportunity to work on simplified graphs. Each graph
consists of vertices that are connected together via arches.

Functionality:
  - adding/deleting vertices
  - creating/deleting arches
  - editing whole vertex at once
  - formatted printing altogether with basic info 
  - resizing/clearing graphs
  - finding arches
  - importing from files (soon)
  - generating by a chatbot (soon)

This program is really safe in terms of
the input security - all the words are
carefully analysed. Pretty color scheme
makes this program even more pleasant.
Works both on Linux and Windows OS.
